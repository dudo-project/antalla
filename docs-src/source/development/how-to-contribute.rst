How to Contribute
=================

The project is still in early stage and any help is more than welcome.
There are quite a few area where we could benefit some help:

New exchanges
  We currently only support a few exchanges.
  The more we can add, the more interesting the data will become.
  We therefore want to integrate with new exchanges (either centralized or decentralized)

New visualizations
  We only have a couple of visualizations available. Any visualizations
  adding insight to the data would be nice to have.

Database backends
  We currently support PostgreSQL and are working on adding support
  for `BigQuery`_ but other databases, `Redshift`_ for example, would be nice to have

Integration testing
  Although we currently have a suite of unit tests, we are still missing integration tests


Please send us a PR, or open an issue, on GitHub if you would like to help with any of these.
